## Getting around and using the server
Being in a big server can be confusing at times, and with hundreds or thousands of members active around the clock, you can feel lost or confused, or not understand “How?” some things work or “Why?” some things are the way they are. This section aims to guide you through basic server functions and etiquette!

### Verification
*(Never seen the #verification channel? Feel free to skip this section.)*

This server is very large, and generally very large servers tend to be very large targets for phishing, scamming, and spamming attacks from malicious users.

## TF2 basics

### Console
To open the in-game console, press the `~` (tilde) key on your keyboard at any time while in-game. Its location may vary depending on the keyboard, but for the vast majority of keyboards, it is directly to the left of the number `1` key.

If the console does not immediately open, you may have to first enable it. There are two ways to do this:
1. Launch the game with the [`-console` option](#launch-options).
2. In TF2, open Settings, and go to the **Keyboard → Advanced** section, and check `Enable developer console`.

### Launch options
If you need (or want) to specify special launch options for TF2 that apply when the game opens, follow these simple steps:
1. Go to your Steam Library.
2. Right-click on "Team Fortress 2".
3. Click on "Properties".
4. On the bottom of the "General" tab, enter your launch options there.

Some useful launch options:
- `-novid`: Skips the Valve intro video, going straight to the main menu.
- `-nojoy`: Disables joystick/gamepad detection. Can improve load times if you are not planning on playing with a controller.
- `-w xxx -h yyy`: Forces the game resolution width to `xxx` and height to `yyy`.
- `-windowed`: Forces the game to run in a window instead of fullscreen.
- `-fullscreen`: Forces the game to run in fullscreen instead of a window.
- `-noborder`: When used with `-windowed`, removes the title border on the game window. This can be used to run the game in "borderless fullscreen" with the correct resolution.
