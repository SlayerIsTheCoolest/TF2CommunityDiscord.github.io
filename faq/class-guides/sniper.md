As Sniper, you want to always be as efficient as possible, and restrict the enemy team's movements.\\
Flanking and tunnel-vision (and enemy Snipers) are your biggest enemy. You can easily get so focused on sniping someone you get headshot or flanked, or backstabbed.\\
You generally want to quickscope, for tankier targets you can charge up, as most run/hide after the 1st or 2nd quickscope.\\
After each quickscope, make sure to check your surroundings (especially your back), try to quickscope as many people as you can find on your flanks, it deals with them fast or scares them off. Also good for improvement.\\

Your priorities are:
1. Enemy Snipers - Enemy snipers are your absolute biggest enemy, as they can 1 shot you without overheal uncharged.\\
You want to focus the enemy sniper as much as possible, and during the time the enemy sniper is dead, you want to be as aggressive as possible and get as many kills as you can until he respawns.\\
Crosshair placement is key for sniper duels, you can prescope and place your crosshair on head level for an easier time, this'll usually eliminate second scopers.
2. Medic - The Medic is obviously extremely high priority, but enemy Snipers are still the highest. Get as many chances on killing the Medic as you can.
3. Powerclasses (Soldier, Demoman, Heavy) they are the main DPS of the team, you want to focus them after the Medic/Sniper.
4. Everyone else

Not too much here, these are what you always just generally want to kill, just the ones above are what you want to especially kill.
You are a glass cannon, do not underestimate how much enemies want you dead. Especially the Spy and enemy Sniper. If you do well as Sniper, you do very well, if you do bad, you do VERY bad.

Learning map spots/Sniper spots is extremely valuable, along with getting used to listening for spies.

Sniper has a rough learning process. And I've seen quite a lot of people try to get good and then give up.

Let's put it down here:\\
If you want to get good at Sniper, you have to be dedicated and patient. It takes a lot of practice, and there will be a lot of bad days, it's normal, don't give up.

Some things that you can get for your PC setup to help you:
- 144+ Hz monitor (going from 60 Hz to 144 is a godsend, trust me)
- PC that can run TF2 at a **stable** FPS (you want it to be as stable as possible, as unstable FPS can ruin your shots, yes configs are completely fine and I 100% recommend those)
- Get a comfortable mousepad, mouse and keyboard. (I have a Logitech G502 Hero SE, it is a bit of a heavier mouse, so I'm going to get a mousepad with a little less cloth to move more freely, this stuff is actually very important, it's the bread and butter of sniping)
- Make sure you're all around comfortable, you want to feel good sniping, not on edge.

Other than that, make sure you **PRACTICE** a LOT. Force yourself to go for headshots, innovate gameplay based on what went wrong after a death. Learn from better players. Gamesense is also extremely important, aim alone isn't enough, quit playing with your ego.

There will be bad days and good days, it is part of it all. Don't give up or feel down if you have a little bit of a bad day. 

You need a good mindset for this. Set your mindset to improvement, there will be better players, but that's okay. Just because you missed some shots doesn't make you the worst player in the world, it won't bring you anywhere.

Also, please, when sniping, relax. Don't let your emotions control you.
