- Play on payload for a better general experience
- Always keep track of enemy snipers, you need to know when they're dangerous and when they aren't
- Sniper is pretty straight forward: Make sure that nobody is flanking you (Spy/Scout/Soldier)
- “Is my flank safe?” If yes, take the Sniper duels
- “Are all the enemy snipers 100% dead?” If yes, you can focus other classes and try to be as efficient as possible until the snipers respawn
- Now how do you clear flanks? Check around you for a split second whenever you're not in danger, try to quickscope anyone you see (better for long-term improvement)
- How do you beat Sniper in Sniper duels? The most important strategy is to mainly scope in before peeking, you want to peek slowly and check every Sniper spot one by one, here crosshair placement is the key to victory (you can always flick to correct your mistake but it's not precise). This strategy will save you from the second scopers most of the time
- Of course you can adapt your gameplay, remember to be always unpredictable, dont peek from the same spot over and over again for example
- To add on, keep an eye out for Spies, certain spots on the map make it easier for the Spy and some don’t. Don’t hardscope for too long or you will get punished 9/10 times. It’s also happened to me quite a few times that I didn’t realize (in time) that we were overrun and it was time to retreat, make sure you keep an eye on that as well. I’d recommend charging up on tankier targets as from my experience they just run and hide after the first or 2nd quickscope.
- For primaries, use stock (Bazaar if you’re really stomping); secondaries, SMG/Cozy Camper/Razorback/Darwin's; for your melee, stock or Shahanshah
