<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
- Your grenade launcher is not your primary, your stickies are
- Pipes are for self defense and extra spam when you don't have stickies loaded
- All demo gameplay in a sense can be boiled down to area denial, every sticky is its own trap, shooting a sticky at an enemy is denying where they're standing
- Learn to lead your pipes and stickies, shoot them where they'll be not where they are, you have no hitscan weapons, dont act like you do
- You are best at mid range, ok at longer range and weak in close range
- You are one of the main engines of a team, if a Medic isn't giving you good heals he's not doing his job
- If you are in a close range fight, bait your teammates, demo is allowed to do so
- Dustbowl is Demoman elementary school, play that a lot to get better
- You are the Engineer's worst enemy, make him suffer
