<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
1. Your grenade launcher is not your primary, your stickies are
2. Pipes are for self defense and extra spam when you don't have stickies loaded
3. All demo gameplay in a sense can be boiled down to area denial, every sticky is its own trap, shooting a sticky at an enemy is denying where they're standing
4. Learn to lead your pipes and stickies, shoot them where they'll be not where they are, you have no hitscan weapons, dont act like you do
5. You are best at mid range, ok at longer range and weak in close range
6. You are one of the main engines of a team, if a medic isn't giving you good heals he's not doing his job
7. If you are in a close range fight, bait your teammates, demo is allowed to do so
8. Dustbowl is demo elementary school, play that a lot to get better
9. You are the engineer's worst enemy, make him suffer
