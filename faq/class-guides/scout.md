Scout is very fast, you want to and you need to use his speed as much as possible.

Being faster than everyone means you can pick your fights. This is crucial when playing Scout. If you feel like you're in a bad situation (for example, multiple people trying to attack you, or you have to fight a Pyro in his flamethrower range), just **RUN AWAY**.

Scout is a killing machine in 1v1 situations but very weak against multiple players because his health pool is very low, you want to avoid 1v2s or 1v3s for example.

Some YouTube videos to help you get better at aiming:

Now tips for 1v1 situations:
- **Scout**: Check the video about Scout MGE basics 
- **Soldier**: You want to have the high ground, otherwise it's a very hard matchup. Use your double jumps wisely, don't waste them or else you give a free shot to the Soldier
- **Pyro**: If you know there's a health pack very close you can just run into the Pyro and kill him in two/three shots before his flamethrower kills you, otherwise you just stay in midrange and he won't do anything
- **Demoman**: You want to rush into him before he protects himself with stickybombs, dont forget to strafe or he will hit you with pipes
- **Heavy**: If he isnt revved up he is not dangerous, jump around him and don't miss a shot. If he is revved up it's tougher but not impossible, jump over him and mess with him. The most important thing you have to do is rush very close to him, at midrange he will shred you
- **Engineer**: Without a sentry he is just a bad scout, be wary of where his sentry is though
- **Sniper**: Don't be predictable in your movement, care about quickscopes, don't run in a straight line, don't get too close to him or he might have a chance to kill you with a melee hit + a bodyshot. If youre a bit too far away from him, use your pistol to punch their aim up and make them flinch
- **Spy**: He is not very hard to kill as long as you aim properly, care about trickstabs since you're very fast, care about Ambassador/Diamondback but that's it
