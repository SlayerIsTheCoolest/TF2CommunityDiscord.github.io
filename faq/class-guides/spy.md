<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
- Use your gun (stock is best, don't touch the Diamondback). L'Etranger is good if you rely heavily on your knife. Keep in mind that you can consistently 3-4 shot light classes at close-mid range with stock. With the stock revolver, you are in theory able to win fights against scouts and soldiers if you land the first shot and dodge even one of their shots.
- Cloak is invaluable, don't trade on demand free positioning for a get outta jail free card (in the form of the [^DR]). And [^C&D] tends to build bad habits of doing nothing. Stock cloak keeps you moving and keeps you active.
- Your knife is a tool for picks, but don't rely on it exclusively for kills. Stock, Big Earner and [^YER] are fun in pubs. Kunai in pubs teaches you an aggressive playstyle that'll cause you more trouble than it's worth down the line.
- Find routes, bits of map geometry, places where people tend to gather in the maps you play and prey on them there.
- Find techniques you can refine to use consistently and incorperate into your playstyle, trickstabs are an example but not the only thing you can do as Spy. 
- Find ways for your gameplay to improve, note mistakes and find ways around them. 
- There are so many ways to play spy, I personally play full stock with around a 60/40 knife to gun kills ratio. Others favor their knives for all of their kills, others prefer the [^Amby] as a playstyle addition to add more damage at mid-close range. I used to exclusively use the Big Earner, L'Etranger, and [^C&D] as a stoplight playstyle where stopping and going is the name of the game. Between waiting for the right moment and chains of stabs where the speed boost drives your effective engagement range after stabs.
- Find a way to play this canvas of a class that best suits your ever-evolving ever-improving and ever-growing playstyle.

“There is one word that describes spy as a class well.\\
And that word is potential.”
